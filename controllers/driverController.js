    // Distance (a, b) = âˆš(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2, where square root is applied to the entire formula

    // STEP 4: this is connected to previous task. When the driver's document passes all the eligible criteria, take that document and at the same time calculate the distance between the driver and the customer right away. This is a little query optimization thing.

    // STEP 5: iterate through the recent driver documents you have (after they have passed all criterias) and pick the driver with the lowest distance between that driver and customer, and send it as JSON document to the client
